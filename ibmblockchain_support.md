## Security incidents
{: #blockchain-security-incidents}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform 2.5.2 provides the following methods for investigating and reporting security incidents:

- Search known IBM security issues on the [IBM Product Security Incident Response](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/). You can filter the issues by severity.
- Report your security issue to the [IBM Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-psirt). Reporting methods for third-parties and anonymous sources are also provided.
- IBM support subscribers can log in and open a case with the appropriate severity. Refer to details, including IBM response times, below in [Submitting support cases](/docs/blockchain-sw-252?topic=blockchain-sw-252-blockchain-support#blockchain-support-cases).
